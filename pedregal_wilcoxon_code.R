#wilcoxon rank-sum power calc 

#https://rdrr.io/cran/rstatix/man/wilcox_effsize.html
#The effect size r is calculated as Z statistic divided by 
#square root of the sample size (N) (Z/âˆš{N}). 
#The Z value is extracted from either coin::wilcoxsign_test() (case of one- or paired-samples test) 
#or coin::wilcox_test() (case of independent two-samples test).

#Usage
#n.wilcox.ord(power = 0.8, alpha = 0.05, t, p, q)
#Arguments
#power required Power
#alpha required two-sided Type-I-error level
#t sample size fraction n/N, where n is sample size of group B and N is the total sample size
#p vector of expected proportions of the categories in group A, should sum to 1
#q vector of expected proportions of the categories in group B, should be of equal
#length as p and should sum to 1
